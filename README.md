# Smart-price-prediction
  Quality prediction, is very much important in the agricultural sector as the price of the crop depends on it. The aim is to predict the crop price based on its quality. Here with the help of image processing and various machine learning algorithms , first we find the quality of the crop and by its quality our system automatically predicts the price. The implementation of one of the recent advancement in technology such as, Machine Learning is one of the solutions for predicting price the crop(fruits and vegetables).The price of the crop is predicted by using image processing and CNN algorithm.
  This project identifies the freshness of fruit and depending on the freshness and quality we are analyzing the price of the fruit or vegetable.
